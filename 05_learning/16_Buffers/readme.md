# What are Buffers?

A Buffer is a chunk of raw binary data.
Itâ€™s like a tiny block of memory â€” a fixed-size box that holds bytes (0s and 1s).

In Node.js, Buffers let you work directly with binary data.

Theyâ€™re similar to arrays, but each element is a byte (8 bits).

They handle raw data that doesnâ€™t fit nicely as plain strings.

# Why do Buffers exist?
JavaScript was designed for browsers â€” mostly text (HTML, JSON, strings).
But Node.js runs on servers â€” and servers must deal with binary data:

âœ… Files (images, videos, PDFs)
âœ… Network packets (TCP streams, HTTP bodies)
âœ… Cryptography (hashes, keys, encryption)
âœ… Protocols (binary formats, custom data)

The Buffer class lets Node.js handle this efficiently, without converting everything to strings.



## Letâ€™s make this crystal clear:

When you create a Buffer in Node.js, youâ€™re literally creating a chunk of raw bytes in memory â€” just like low-level languages do (like C or C++).

ðŸ“‚ Example: Buffer is raw bytes
```js
const buf = Buffer.from('ABC');
console.log(buf); // <Buffer 41 42 43>
'A' â†’ 0x41 (hex) â†’ 65 (decimal)

'B' â†’ 0x42 â†’ 66

'C' â†’ 0x43 â†’ 67
```
So buf holds the actual binary representation:
```bash
01000001 01000010 01000011
```
Each letter â†’ 1 byte (8 bits).
When you .toString() the Buffer, Node decodes the bytes back into characters
