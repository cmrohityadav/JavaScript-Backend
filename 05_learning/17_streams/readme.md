# What is a Stream?

- A Stream is just an abstract interface for working with streaming data in chunks instead of all at once.

## Node.js has 4 main stream types:

### Readable â†’ read data (like fs.createReadStream)

### Writable â†’ write data (like fs.createWriteStream)

### Duplex â†’ both read + write (like TCP socket)

### Transform â†’ duplex + modify data (like zlib.createGzip())

##  Why Streams?
- If you read a 1GB file:

-> Without Stream: Load entire 1GB in RAM.

-> With Stream: Read small chunks (64KB by default) â†’ process â†’ discard â†’ next chunk.

This is memory-efficient & works great for I/O:

- Files

- HTTP requests/responses

- TCP sockets

- zlib compression

- process.stdin, process.stdout

## Core Concepts
ðŸ‘‰ Event-based:
A Stream is an EventEmitter.
Important events:

- data â†’ When chunk available

- end â†’ No more data

- error â†’ Something failed

- close â†’ Closed
